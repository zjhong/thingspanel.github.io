# Design concept

## Idea

- Design the system with common sense thinking.
- Simple solutions to complex problems.
- Higher abstraction.
- Simplified system with standardized components

## Standard Devices

The same temperature humidity sensor may have thousands of factories, different specification types, but they are all<b>temperature humidity sensors</b>

The input of the temperature and humidity sensor is temperature, humidity, time.Output is the current temperature, current humidity, temperature curve, humidity curve or statement.The quantity and relationship of these inputs and outputs are determined.

Therefore, we also abstract the software component of the temperature humidity sensor as a standard temperature sensor component, which includes fixed data input and result output.and make it a standard brick in the Web Building.
